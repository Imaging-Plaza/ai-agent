# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-22

### Added
- Gradio space runner tool working on the drag-and-dropped image.
- Repo info tool extracting relevant information in markdown for the agent.

### Fixed
- Gradio UI: bound `clear.click(...)` inside the Blocks context to prevent “Cannot call click outside of a gradio.Blocks context”.
- Chatbot: migrated to `type="messages"` by adding a conversion shim (pairs <-> messages) in the handler to satisfy the new schema.
- UI polish: hide the “Demo link” textbox and “Run demo on preview” button at launch and until a tool is found; reveal them after recommendations appear and on selection, and hide again on Clear.
- Cache is now cleaned correctly.
- Fixed the preview for the png files.
